Glossary Terms:
**Branch** - A branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches.
**Clone** - A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.
**Commit** - A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).
**Fetch** - When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them.
**GIT** - First developed back in 2005, Git is an extremely popular version control system that is at the heart of a wide variety of high-profile projects. Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) and gives you a self-contained record of your ongoing programming versions.
**GitHub** - GitHub is designed as a Git repository hosting service. Itâ€™s an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version control projects outside your local computer/server. Unlike Git, GitHub is exclusively cloud-based.
**Merge** - Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. A merge can be done through a pull request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line.
**Merge Conflict** - A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.
**Push** - To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.
**Pull** - Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.
**Remote** - This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.
**Repository** - A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history.
